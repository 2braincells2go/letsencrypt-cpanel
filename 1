  letsencrypt [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d domain] [-d domain] ...

The Let's Encrypt agent can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By
default, it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing
the cert. Major SUBCOMMANDS are:

  (default) run        Obtain & install a cert in your current webserver
  certonly             Obtain cert, but do not install it (aka "auth")
  install              Install a previously obtained cert in a server
  revoke               Revoke a previously obtained certificate
  rollback             Rollback server configuration changes made during install
  config_changes       Show changes made to server config during installation
  plugins              Display information about installed plugins
